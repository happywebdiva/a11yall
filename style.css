The All Y'all Theme is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2013 Automattic, Inc., and Adobe's Accessible Mega Menu (http://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/). 

It is search engine optimized - supporting the use of Yoast's SEO plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) including his use of breadcrumb trails - and also works well without Yoast's plugin. 

Currently it has five page templates:
     1. Private Page Template (useful for "member-only" sections of the site)
		 2. Page Without Title Template (useful for some landing pages)
		 3. Page Without Sidebar Template
		 4. Page Without Sidebar or Title Template (useful for some landing pages)
		 5. Site Map Template (a simple alternative if you don't want to hand-build a site map for your site)

Note that on small screens only the first and last menu items appear; consider making one of these "Site Map."  On large screens the menu levels are limited to two for accessibility reasons.

When I officially releasae this theme, I'll mush all the CSS into this file instead of using @import -- which creates unneccessary HTTP requests, but is convenient for CSS debugging in development.
