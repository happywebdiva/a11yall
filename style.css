ABL Parent Theme is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2013 Automattic, Inc., and Adobe's Accessible Mega Menu (http://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/). Note that on small screens only the first and last menu items appear; consider making one of those two "Site Map."  On large screens only two levels of menu work for accessibility reasons.

TO DO	
	- Mobile
		- check in Android

	- update apple touch icon -- make new image so not H5BP star (152x152px)
		- test new icon on iphone
	- Reduce CSS with http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201311/cutting_down_on_vendor_prefixes/

	- Do a11y check
				- Review BAD site for ideas on what to double check

	- Get KS working again - see notes in  /abl-child-kitchensink/style.css
	- Consider for KS - http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creative-coding/making-use-of-the-genericons-font-in-your-website/
	- get non-essential sytle over into kitchen sink
	- go thru starter style.css and add more @@'s as needed
		- OK to have wp_footer(); outside of div .container and <footer>? If not, alter KS footer.php too
	- integrate in H5BP
	- back this up by sending to twc/blog 
	- test in IE7 
 	- make responsive & html5 backwards compatible 
	- clean up tabs file by file when brain dead
	- tighten code by reducing php calls
	- work on favicons -- how to get right according to parent or child themes -- overriding root too?
	- move non-essential files to a library theme
	- review all @@@ 
	- validate theme
	- run Theme Check plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-check/
	- find or build an accessible contact form
	- go thru WCAG?
	- consider integrating with Joe Dolson's plugin
	- go thru /temp/styling.css to see if need all of this stuff, e.g. buttons
	- compare with Genesis framework if I feel like it
	- update jquery in .js
	- test jquery to be sure fully functioning
	
	- move these files to new abl folder for ABL Parent Theme (consider name of this, e.g. maybe Ba11y for beautiful accessible)
		- Do NOT change anything besides this file and folder name for moving out of dev
		- For now dev version, collapse css and put in this file (style.css)
		- Include a summary table of contents for style.css
		
	- when ready to do church child theme, go back to _s code (in abl_s theme) and check out inc/custom-header.php
			There's also a very brief explanation of it in the README.md file
			Might also look into abl_s/inc/template-tags.php
	
	- set up a custom css with commented out things like limiting mobile nav to just two items

/* TO DO when using this theme

THEME SETUP
- Go through and change all of the "ab" things (e.g. ABasic) to new name -- check functions.php and style.css in particular
- Update meta above, esp. Theme Name

SITE SETUP 
- Temporarily, if possible, in wp-config.php, add or turn on "define('WP_DEBUG', true);"
- In wp-config, set up Authentication Unique Keys and Salts 
- In wp-config, max out # of post revisions, e.g. define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 5);
- In wp-config, if want change default autosave from 60 secs., e.g. define('AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL', 180 );
- For more wp-config good ideas, see online or in Evernote
	     http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/security/conquering-the-wp-config-php-file-11-good-practices/
- If doing multisite, in wp-config turn on the multisite function

FILE REVIEW
- Review functions.php to see what is needed and what isn't
- Review all of the files to be sure needed; probably repurpose demo-*.php files to meet some other needs
- Page-about.php is an example of making a more granular template for a page -- based on slug or ID.
- Consider adding the following theme files: author.php, links.php, taxonomy.php -- see p. 144-5 of "Beginning WP 3"
- Check to see if 404.php works

KITCHENSINK POSSIBILIES
- pull some of the more stylish stuff out of starters
- category-uncategorized.php
	Special category-slug page  (http://localhost:8888/local/wp/category/uncategorized/)
- demo-multloops.php 
	A demo page for setting and resetting multiple loops (3 in this example, though it's all set for more)
	http://localhost:8888/local/wp/featured-news-page/
- demo-quote.php
	A demo page for using the versatile query_posts() with the "post format" of "quote" & has_post_format()
- footer.php
	pull customized js/main.js and plugins.js
	google analytics a la H5BP

SITE LAUNCH
- Review php error log if possible
- If nec., in wp-config.php, change debug to "define('WP_DEBUG', false);"
- Check again to see if 404.php works
