Domain Path: /languages/
Tags: Accessible, H5BP, @@@? (see http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/about for theme tags)

ABL Parent Theme is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2013 Automattic, Inc., and Adobe's Accessible Mega Menu (http://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/). Note that on small screens only the first and last menu items appear; consider making one of those two "Site Map."  On large screens only two levels of menu work for accessibility reasons.

TO DO	

- Do a11y check
				- Review BAD site for ideas on what to double check
				- validate theme
				- consider integrating with Joe Dolson's plugin
				- may need to repeat these steps again later

- Improve jQuery call -- maybe figure out how to do in separate theme?
	
- Make more ready for congregations & NVC - incorporating some of these ideas
	- Like WebAIM, use magnifying glass icon instead of search button?
	- Like Nomensa, have Facebook, Twitter, etc., in circles -- maybe use font icon for this?
	- Like Heard Library, have upper right pulldown for Search | Members | A-Z Index
	- Set up A-Z Index page that's automatically included with theme?

- Set up a custom css with commented out things like limiting mobile nav to just two items
		
- Possibility: Reduce CSS with http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201311/cutting_down_on_vendor_prefixes/

- Possibility: Apple Touch Icon
	- <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri() ?>/img/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png">
	- currently the image is in the images folder of kitchensink

- Possibility: Expand and clean up functions.php
		- Enable support for Post Thumbnails on posts and pages?
		- Enable support for Post Formats?
		- Setup the WordPress core custom background feature?

- Possibility: Find or build an accessible contact form

- Possibility: Get KS working again - see notes in  /abl-child-kitchensink/style.css
	- Consider Genericons Font for KS - http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creative-coding/making-use-of-the-genericons-font-in-your-website/
	- get non-essential sytle over into kitchen sink
	- work on favicons -- how to get right according to parent or child themes -- overriding root too?
	- go thru /temp/styling.css to see if need all of this stuff, e.g. buttons
	- compare with Genesis framework if I feel like it

- Possibility: when ready to do church child theme, go back to _s code (in abl_s theme) and check out inc/custom-header.php
			There's also a very brief explanation of it in the README.md file
			Might also look into abl_s/inc/template-tags.php
	
- LAST MINUTE
	- run Theme Check plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-check/
	- tighten code by reducing php calls
	- Clean up @@ marked code
	- Include a summary table of contents for style.css
	- squish css together :-)
	- update jquery in .js
	- test jquery to be sure fully functioning

 */
 
/* TO DO when using this theme

THEME SETUP
- Go through and change all of the "ab" things (e.g. ABasic) to new name -- check functions.php and style.css in particular
- Update meta above, esp. Theme Name

SITE SETUP 
- Temporarily, if possible, in wp-config.php, add or turn on "define('WP_DEBUG', true);"
- In wp-config, set up Authentication Unique Keys and Salts 
- In wp-config, max out # of post revisions, e.g. define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 5);
- In wp-config, if want change default autosave from 60 secs., e.g. define('AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL', 180 );
- For more wp-config good ideas, see online or in Evernote
	     http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/security/conquering-the-wp-config-php-file-11-good-practices/
- If doing multisite, in wp-config turn on the multisite function

FILE REVIEW
- Review functions.php to see what is needed and what isn't
- Review all of the files to be sure needed; probably repurpose demo-*.php files to meet some other needs
- Page-about.php is an example of making a more granular template for a page -- based on slug or ID.
- Consider adding the following theme files: author.php, links.php, taxonomy.php -- see p. 144-5 of "Beginning WP 3"
- Check to see if 404.php works

KITCHENSINK POSSIBILIES
- pull some of the more stylish stuff out of starters
- category-uncategorized.php
	Special category-slug page  (http://localhost:8888/local/wp/category/uncategorized/)
- demo-multloops.php 
	A demo page for setting and resetting multiple loops (3 in this example, though it's all set for more)
	http://localhost:8888/local/wp/featured-news-page/
- demo-quote.php
	A demo page for using the versatile query_posts() with the "post format" of "quote" & has_post_format()
- footer.php
	pull customized js/main.js and plugins.js
	google analytics a la H5BP

SITE LAUNCH
- Review php error log if possible
- If nec., in wp-config.php, change debug to "define('WP_DEBUG', false);"
- Check again to see if 404.php works

DOCUMENTATION
- How to do favicon and apple touch icon
- How to hide last main menu item so shows only on mobile
