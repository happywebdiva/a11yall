== Description ==

The All Y'all Theme is a custom responsive WordPress starter theme, built from the ground up for accessibility and beauty. 

It is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2013 Automattic, Inc., and Adobe's Accessible Mega Menu (http://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/). 

It is search engine optimized - supporting the use of Yoast's SEO plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) including his use of breadcrumb trails - and also works well without Yoast's plugin. 

Currently it has five page templates:
  1. Private Page Template (useful for "member-only" sections of the site)
  2. Page Without Title Template (useful for some landing pages)
  3. Page Without Sidebar Template
  4. Page Without Sidebar or Title Template (useful for some landing pages)
  5. Site Map Template (a simple alternative if you don't want to hand-build a site map for your site)
